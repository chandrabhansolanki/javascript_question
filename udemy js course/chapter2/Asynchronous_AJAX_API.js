// what is AJAX ?
/* Asycnchronus javascript And XML : Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. with AJAX calls we can request data from web servers dynamically*/

/* Online API = application running on a server that receives request and send data according to the user request */

/* promise = An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous*/
// promise is container for a future value.

// diff between async await and promise
// promise
// 1 Promise is an object representing intermediate state of operation which is guaranteed to complete its execution at some point in future.
// 2 Promise has 3 states â€“ resolved, rejected and pending.
// 3 Error handling is done using .then() and .catch() methods.

//async await
// 1 Async/Await is a syntactic sugar for promises, a wrapper making the code execute more synchronously.
// 2 it does not have any states. It returns a promise either resolved or rejected.

// 3 Error handling is done using .try() and .catch() methods.

// syntax async await

    const message = await api;
