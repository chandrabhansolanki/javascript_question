// what is node js.

// node js is a open source server it can help us to run a backend program in our computer Terminal . node js is a javascript runtime built on chrome v8 javascript engine  server. We dont need browser to run backend.
// node js is not a library , framwork, language

// why node js ?

// 1.  A common task for a web server can be to open a file a server and return the content to the client.
// 2.  Node js runs single-threaded , non blocking , asynchronous prog. which is every memory is efficeient.
// 3.  Node js eliminates the waiting and simply continues with next request.

// Single-threaded = A node js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request . When node js performs an I/O operation like reading from the network , accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node js will resume the operation when the response comes back.

// with help of node js we can create
//1 html server
//2 Dynamic web application
//3 Database operation
